                <a> I'm a Junior Electrical Engineering student at the Cooper 
                    Union, passionate in tinkering with technology and 
                    programming. I have experience in Software Engineering 
                    (both front-end and back-end) though my primary interests
                    lie in Artificial Intelligence development!
