                    <p> My name's Aidan, and I'm an incoming Senior at The Cooper 
                        Union majoring in electrical engineering! I grew up in 
                        Monroe, Connecticut and attended Masuk High School where 
                        I was an active member of the VEX Robotics team 4478D.
                        Currently, I'm interested in Deep Learning Engineering,
                        focusing on taking classes to aid this passion.

                        <br/> <br/> 
                        At The Cooper Union, I've learned to enjoy the world of 
                        electrical engineering more than I ever thought I would. 
                        I currently have a major GPA of 4.00, an overall GPA of 3.7, 
                        and I am on a track to graduate with a minor in computer 
                        science. Although I have only been a student for two years,
                        I have made countless memories with my friends here and 
                        appreciate the experience it has given me thus far.

                        I joined my High School's VEX Robotics program in my Freshman 
                        year of High School and formed a team with a couple of my close

                        fastest growing middle school and high school robotics program 
                        globally with more than 20,000 teams from 50 countries playing 
                        in over 1,700 competitions worldwide. Each year, an engineering 
                        challenge is presented in the form of a game where the students 
                        build innovative robots and compete year-round. &nbsp;

                        our way to the World Championships at the end of the year 
                        where we placed 28/93 in our division.

                        The 2020-2021 season's game occured during the pandemic, where
                        tournaments were almost all remote and in-person contact was 
                        limited. Despite these challenges, we were still able to set
                        the 3rd highest skills score in the world and 1st in the
                        United States in the early season.

                        We participated in one in-person competition and one fully
                        remote competition where we were able to become tournament
                        champions in both settings.

                        We were able to travel to San Fransisco, CA, and Dallas, TX, to
                        compete with top tier teams going far in each tournament.

                        At the World Championships that year, we ranked second in our
                        divison, being one of only five teams in the competition to
                        go undefeated in the qualifying rounds. Although we ultimately 
                        lost in the semi-finals, our team was awarded the Inspire Award, 
                        an award given to the team that "will have a clear vision 
                        for their future and will participate with both a high level 
                        of integrity and good sportsmanship, believing they can achieve
