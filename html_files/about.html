        <p> 
            My name's Aidan, and I'm an upcoming college sophomore at The Cooper 
            Union majoring in electrical engineering! I grew up in Monroe, 
            Connecticut and attended Masuk High School where I was an active 
            member of the VEX Robotics team 4478D. Currently, I'm engaged in 
            low-level programming for the Cooper Union's Intelligent Ground 
            Vehicle Competition (IGVC) Team.

            The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (The Cooper
            Union) is a private institute located within the East Village in New 
            York City. The school was founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper and offers
            degrees in engineering, art, and architecture.

            <br> <br> 
            At The Cooper Union, I've learned to enjoy the world of electrical 
            engineering more than I would have ever thought and have ultimately
            become fascinated with the subject. I currently have a major GPA
            of 4.00, an overall GPA of 3.7, and am on a track to graduate with
            a minor in computer science.
