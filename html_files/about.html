            My name's Aidan, and I'm an upcoming college sophomore at The Cooper 
            Union majoring in electrical engineering! I grew up in Monroe, 
            Connecticut and attended Masuk High School where I was an active 
            member of the VEX Robotics team 4478D. Currently, I'm engaged in 
            low-level programming for the Cooper Union's Intelligent Ground 
            Vehicle Competition (IGVC) Team.

            The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (The Cooper
            Union) is a private institute located within the East Village in New 
            York City. The school was founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper and offers
            degrees in engineering, art, and architecture.

            <br> <br> 
            At The Cooper Union, I've learned to enjoy the world of electrical 
            engineering more than I would have ever thought and have ultimately
            become fascinated with the subject. I currently have a major GPA
            of 4.00, an overall GPA of 3.7, and am on a track to graduate with
            a minor in computer science. 
            
            <br> <br> Relevant Course Work includes:

            <p> In additon to my coursework, I'm a member of Cooper Union's
                Intelligent Ground Vehicle Compeition (IGVC) Team. IGVC is an 
                annual international robotics competition for teams of 
                undergraduate and graduate students who design and build an 
                autonomous ground vehicle capable of completing several 
                difficult challenges. I specificlly work in the Drive-By-Wire 
                subteam, and worked on the car's battery monitor sensor firmware
                which, recieves and decodes the car battery's raw voltage data 
                then sends it on the car's CAN bus system.
