        My name's Aidan, and I'm an upcoming college sophomore at The Cooper 
        Union majoring in electrical engineering! I grew up in Monroe, 
        Connecticut and attended Masuk High School where I was an active 
        member of the VEX Robotics team 4478D. Currently, I'm engaged in 
        low-level programming for the Cooper Union's Intelligent Ground 
        Vehicle Competition (IGVC) Team.

        The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art (The Cooper
        Union) is a private institute located within the East Village in New 
        York City. The school was founded in 1859 by Peter Cooper and offers
        degrees in engineering, art, and architecture.

        <br> <br> 
        At The Cooper Union, I've learned to enjoy the world of electrical 
        engineering more than I would have ever thought and have ultimately
        become fascinated with the subject. I currently have a major GPA
        of 4.00, an overall GPA of 3.7, and am on a track to graduate with
        a minor in computer science. 

        <br> <br> Relevant Course Work includes:

        <p> In additon to my coursework, I'm a member of Cooper Union's
        Intelligent Ground Vehicle Compeition (IGVC) Team. IGVC is an 
        annual international robotics competition for teams of 
        undergraduate and graduate students who design and build an 
        autonomous ground vehicle capable of completing several 
        difficult challenges. I specificlly work in the Drive-By-Wire 
        subteam, and worked on the car's battery monitor sensor firmware
        which, recieves and decodes the car battery's raw voltage data 
        then sends it on the car's CAN bus system.

        I joined my High School's VEX Robotics program in my Freshman 
        year of High School and formed a team with a couple of my close 
        friends. The VEX Robotics Compeittion (VRC) is the largest and 
        fastest growing middle school and high school robotics program 
        globally with more than 20,000 teams from 50 countries playing 
        in over 1,700 competitions worldwide. Each year, an engineering 
        challenge is presented in the form of a game where the students 
        build innovative robots and compete year-round.

        To learn more about VEX Robotics or this year's game, click
        <a href="https://roboticseducation.org/vex-robotics-competition/">
            here</a>. 

        On my team, I took on the role as the programmer as it was the 
        only vacant slot and we became team 4478D.

        <br><br>
        We quickly found our stride, winning the first three 
        tournaments we attended, and found our way to the World
        Championships at the end of the year where we placed 28/93 in 
        our division.

        Although the next year started off slow, we went on to win five
        tournaments, one of them being a national championship, and set
        the world record for the highest scoring 15-second autonomous 
        mode before shutting down due to the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>

        The next year's game occured during the pandemic, where
        tournaments were almost all remote and in-person contact was 
        limited. We were still able to participate in and win two
        tournaments as well as set the the 3rd highest skills score in 
        the world and first in the United States in the early season. </p>

        Finally in our senior year, we were able to rank first in six
        of the ten tournaments we attended, going undefeated at both 
        the Southern New England Regional Championships and the VEX
        Robotics World Championships during the qualityfing rounds. 
        We were able to travel to San Fransisco, CA, and Dallas, TX, to
        compete with top tier teams going far in each tournament. At
        the World Championships that year, we ranked second in our
        divison and ultimately went out in the semi-finals but were 
        awarded the Inspire Award, an award given to the team that 
        "will have a clear vision for their future and will participate 
        with both a high level of integrity and good sportsmanship, 
        believing they can achieve what they set out to achieve through 
        their diligence"

        While in high school, in addition to attending Masuk, I was also
        enrolled in the Bridgeport Regional Aquaculture Science and 
        Technology Education Center (BRASTEC or Aqua). There, I took my
        general science courses such as biology, chemistry, and physics,
        but also engaged in oceanography, analytical chemistry, costal
        navigation & piloting, and other marine courses. Weekly class
        would be held on the school's research vessel to study and
        identify organisms in the Long Island Sound, and I captained
        the school's National Ocean Sciences Bowl Team my senior year
        where we ended as regional semi-finalists.

        I was born in late September 2004 an grew up in Monroe, 
        Connecticut along with my three sisters and two dogs. When not 
        involved in academics, you could probably find me exploring the streets
        and parks in New York City, belting lyrics in concerts, playing games
        with friends, and much more! 

        <br> <br> 
        Some other hobbies I have are solving Rubik's Cubes (3x3 PR is
        19.45 seconds), studying maps and geography, working on little 
        projects, playing game pigeon word hunt, and hanging out with friends
        and family.
