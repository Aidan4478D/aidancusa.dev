## Aidan Cusa's Personal Website

Repository for personal website.

In early 2022, I created the site, statically programmed in HTML and styled with CSS (see old_site if interested).

In 2023, I redesigned the site to be more visually appealing and user friendly by incorporating JavaScript elements.

In 2024, I decided to transition the site to be a React App and included many fancy features to it!

Now in 2025, I am redesigning the UO/UX to make the site more simple and professional.


### Deploy React App on GitHub pages
