## Aidan Cusa's Personal Website

Repository for personal website.

It was originally a static site programmed in HTML and styled with CSS (see old_site if interested) but I eventually realized React JS is infinitely better so now it's running off of a React App!

### Deploy React App on GitHub pages

Folow tutorial here to set up React App with GitHub Pages: https://github.com/gitname/react-gh-pages

Then run `$ npm run deploy -- -m "Commit message to pages"` to deploy the React App onto www.aidancusa.dev domain
